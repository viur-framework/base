# ViUR base

**base** provides a basic ViUR project structure.

This is the best place to start a new ViUR project from!

---

## Usage

Clone the base repository including its submodules into a new directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viur-framework/base.git your-project
cd your-project
```

Then, to make sure that the placeholders in `app.yaml` and `viur_server.py` are properly replaced and that you won't accidentally override the viur-base repo, use the included `clean-base.py` script.

You need to enter an author name and an app ID to identify your app for later deployment and to be able to run the `dev_appserver.py` locally. These interactively prompted values can also be provided as command-line parameters.

The script will also initialize and update the submodules and disconnect the repo from the viur-base repository origin.

```bash
python clean-base.py
```

When finished, your repository is disconnected from [base](https://github.com/viur-framework/base) as its origin, and can be configured to point to another origin where your new project lives in future. It still contains the full history of the base repository. This might be wanted - if not, make `rm -rf .git` to drop the entire history and start over setting up a clean project with `git init`.

### Switch sub-modules to SSH

Especially in ViUR development projects or for customer projects created at [Mausbrand](https://www.mausbrand.de/en) that are heavily involved in changes to server and vi, it is necessary to change the HTTPS submodules to SSH. This can easily be done for all submodules and their submodules with these few commands:

```bash
# change server
pushd deploy/server
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/server.git
popd

# change vi
pushd vi
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/vi.git
cd html5
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/html5.git
cd ../public/icons
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/icons.git
popd

# change ignite
pushd sources/less/ignite
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:viur-framework/ignite.git
popd
```
